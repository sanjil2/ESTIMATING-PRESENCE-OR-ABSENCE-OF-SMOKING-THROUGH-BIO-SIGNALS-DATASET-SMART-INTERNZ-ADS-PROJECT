Estimating-Presence-or-Absence-of-Smoking-Through-Bio-Signals-Dataset

The estimation of smoking behavior is of significant interest in various fields, including healthcare, public health, and behavior analysis. Traditional methods for assessing smoking status rely on self-reporting, which can be prone to bias and inaccuracies. However, advancements in technology and the availability of bio-signal datasets have opened up new possibilities for estimating smoking behavior objectively. This project aims to provide an overview of using bio-signals to estimate the presence or absence of smoking, offering insights into the methods and techniques employed in this field.
